    Welcome to Example "Nodejs Thailand WebPage" that build from Nodejs, Express under
    Docker for NodeJS version 1.0. This example webpage is come from container technology (Docker)

  p.
    Docker and Container Technology is formally call "OS level virtualization" and also 
    known as containerization, refers to an operating system feature in which the kernel
     allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances. Such instances, 
     called containers,[1] partitions, virtualization engines (VEs) or jails 
     (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail), may look like real computers from the point of view 
     of programs running in them. A computer program running on an ordinary person's 
     computer's operating system can see all resources (connected devices, files and folders
     , network shares, CPU power, quantifiable hardware capabilities) of that computer. 
     However, programs running inside a container can only see the container's contents 
     and devices assigned to the container.
